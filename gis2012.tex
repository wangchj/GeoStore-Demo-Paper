\begin{abstract}
Geo-Store is a geospatial data management system for data expressed in the resource description framework (RDF). Our system implements common spatial query types in terms of SPARQL query filters, which allow user to perform query operations based on spatial relationships. To efficiently evaluating spatial queries, our system implements spatial-aware hashing for geographic data. Geospatial data management in semantic web data is an emerging research field, and our system shows the advantages of integrating GIS with semantic web. For more information, our system can be accessed at http://ilab.auburn.edu/geostore.
