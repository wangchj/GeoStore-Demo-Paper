\section{Conclusions}
In this demonstration, we present Geo-Store, a spatially-aware data management system built on the RDF-3X~\cite{DBLP:journals/vldb/NeumannW10}. By the augmentation of the standard SPARQL language with spatial filters, Geo-Store is able to process complex queries with common spatial constraints. Due to the use of the spatially-aware hashing, Geo-Store manages to provide an efficient solution to evaluate SPARQL queries with spatial constraints without any price on accuracy.
