\section{Conclusions}
Our system implements spatial query types in the form of SPARQL query filtesr. Currently, the filters types are window query, range (with and without binding), and nearby queries. The query analyzer uses the spatial-aware hashing index to facilitate the evaluation of spatial queries.
